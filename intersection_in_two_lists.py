Method1:
for x in i: # loop through list i put in x
    if x in j: # if items in x are in list j print x is the variable that holds results
        print(x)
        
Method2:
c = [a for a in i if a in j]
print(c)

Method3:
b = list(set(i).intersection(j)) #intersection is an python method | (âˆ©) symbol of intersection
print(b)

Method4:
n = [a for a in i if a in j and(j.pop(j.index(a)) or True)]
print(n)
